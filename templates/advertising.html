                <p class="p1">
                    WELLnest accepts advertising on the WELLnest Network from third parties ("Advertisers"), which may
                    include
                    third party banners, badges, contextual advertising and content created or provided by an Advertiser
                    (collectively referred to as "Advertisements" or "Advertising"). In addition, as used in this
                    policy, the terms "Advertising" and "Advertisements" include third party banners, modules, links,
                    microsites, native advertisements and other content provided by or on behalf of Advertisers. The
                    Advertiser is responsible for the accuracy and objectivity of their Advertising. The following
                    guidelines have been established by WebMD to govern various aspects of Advertising on properties
                    within the WELLnest Network (each a "WebMD Property"), which include websites and mobile
                    applications
                    directed to consumers, which we refer to in this Policy as the "WELLnest Consumer Properties," and
                    websites and mobile applications directed to healthcare professionals, which we refer to as the
                    "WELLnest Professional Properties."<br><br>
                    If you’d like to advertise with WELLnest Media, contact us here. These are the specific guidelines
                    we follow about the types of advertising we accept: <br><br>
                </p>
                <h4 class="pol3">1.<u> We review the ads.</u></h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    We maintain sole discretion for determining the types of ads that will be accepted and displayed on
                    WELLnest Media properties. We reserve the right to reject, cancel, or remove any ads at any time
                    and for any reason. We will provide prompt notice to the advertiser upon rejection, cancellation, or
                    removal of any ad, along with an explanation. We also reserve the right to determine the appropriate
                    placement of ads on WELLnest Media properties.
                </p>
                <h4 class="pol3">2.<u> We don’t endorse any advertised products or services.</u></h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    Although products may appear on our site in the form of advertisements, under no circumstances shall
                    our acceptance of any ad be considered an endorsement of the product(s) and/or service(s)
                    advertised, or for the company that manufactures, distributes, or promotes these product(s) or
                    service(s). In some cases, WELLnest Media’s editorial team may rate or rank certain products or
                    services. These ratings or rankings are determined solely by the editorial team(s) without regard to
                    any financial or advertising relationship that may exist with companies that provide the product or
                    services.
                <h4 class="pol3">3.<u>We will not accept certain types of ads.</u></h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    We will not accept any ad that is factually inaccurate and/or, in our opinion, in poor taste.
                    Pharmaceutical advertising is only accepted for approved indication(s) as determined by the Food and
                    Drug Administration (FDA). Advertised products must be in market and readily available. WELLnest
                    Media will not permit, at any time, the placement of any ad for harmful, illegal, or objectionable
                    products or services. Ads must not contain fraudulent, deceptive, or offensive material, including
                    material that misrepresents, ridicules, or attacks an individual or group on the basis of age,
                    color, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or disability. Ads should not
                    contain defamatory, libelous, slanderous, or threatening information. Ads must not be related to
                    alcohol, firearms, ammunition, fireworks, gambling, pornography, tobacco, political campaigns, or
                    the simulation of news or an emergency. All ads must clearly identify the advertiser. Any ad that
                    could be misconstrued as editorial content will be clearly labeled as an advertisement.
                </p>
                <h4 class="pol3">4.<u>We clearly distinguish ads from editorial content.</u></h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    In every instance, we maintain a distinct separation between advertisements and editorial content.
                    All ads on WELLnest Media properties are clearly and unambiguously identified as such. Clicking on
                    an ad will take the user to an advertiser’s site or to a sponsor’s resource center hosted on a
                    WELLnest Media property. Sponsored resource centers are labeled as such, with the name of the
                    sponsoring entity displayed.
                </p>
                <h4 class="pol3">5.<u>We clearly distinguish between sponsored and non­-sponsored content.</u></h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    WELLnest Media seeks sponsorships from trusted and credible research organizations, manufacturers,
                    and other service providers. Sponsorships provide financial benefit to WELLnest Media, but also
                    benefit our users by providing current information on health services, medications, and treatments.
                    Editorial content sponsored by an advertiser is subject to our editorial policy and is reviewed by
                    our editorial staff and Medical Affairs team. When content (sponsored content, co-created content,
                    or branded content) is provided by or influenced by a named sponsor, we take meaningful steps to
                    ensure our users will not confuse that sponsored content with WELLnest Media’s own original
                    editorial content. Native advertising refers to links or ads within a piece of content that link to
                    other content. WELLnest Media may present advertising messages, advertisements, or sponsored posts
                    in its social media channels.
                </p>
                <h4 class="pol3">6.<u>Affiliate program (e-commerce links in WELLnest Media content)</u></h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    As part of the article creation process, our health and wellness editors will include links to
                    relevant products they feel could be useful to our readers. While all products are chosen
                    independently, we want you to know that Healthline Media may receive a payment if you make a
                    purchase at the retailer’s site within 24 hours of clicking on one of the links we provide.
                </p>
                <h4 class="pol3">7.<u>We clearly distinguish content that is part of a Partner program.</u></h4>
                <p class="p1">
                    Occasionally WELLnest Media will work with products, services, or organizations that align with our
                    mission. WELLnest Media vets these products, services, or organizations for quality and only
                    presents what it feels is valuable to and in the best interest of our users. WELLnest Media does not
                    medically review the content and is not responsible for providing the products or services described
                    on these pages. Any partner content of this type will be labeled with language that indicates it did
                    not go through our standard editorial process and follows these Ad and Sponsorship Policy
                    guidelines. In the instances where WELLnest Media receives a payment when users purchase or sign up
                    for the product or service, the page may also include this language: “WELLnest and our partners may
                    receive a portion of revenues if you make a purchase using a link above.” Partner pages may also
                    include a “what’s this” link that takes users to a page that explains the nature of the partnership.
